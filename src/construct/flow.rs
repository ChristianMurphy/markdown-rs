//! The flow content type.
//!
//! **Flow** represents the sections, such as headings and code, which are
//! parsed per line.
//! An example is HTML, which has a certain starting condition (such as
//! `<script>` on its own line), then continues for a while, until an end
//! condition is found (such as `</style>`).
//! If that line with an end condition is never found, that flow goes until
//! the end.
//!
//! The constructs found in flow are:
//!
//! * [Blank line][crate::construct::blank_line]
//! * [Code (indented)][crate::construct::code_indented]
//! * [Heading (atx)][crate::construct::heading_atx]
//! * [Heading (setext)][crate::construct::heading_setext]
//! * [HTML (flow)][crate::construct::html_flow]
//! * [MDX esm][crate::construct::mdx_esm]
//! * [MDX expression (flow)][crate::construct::mdx_expression_flow]
//! * [MDX JSX (flow)][crate::construct::mdx_jsx_flow]
//! * [Raw (flow)][crate::construct::raw_flow] (code (fenced), math (flow))
//! * [Thematic break][crate::construct::thematic_break]
