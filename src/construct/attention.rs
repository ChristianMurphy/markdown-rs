//! Attention (emphasis, strong, optionally GFM strikethrough) occurs in the
//! [text][] content type.
//!
//! ## Grammar
//!
//! Attention sequences form with the following BNF
//! (<small>see [construct][crate::construct] for character groups</small>):
//!
//! ```bnf
//! attention_sequence ::= 1*'*' | 1*'_'
//! gfm_attention_sequence ::= 1*'~'
//! ```
//!
//! Sequences are matched together to form attention based on which character
//! they contain, how long they are, and what character occurs before and after
//! each sequence.
//! Otherwise they are turned into data.
//!
//! ## HTML
//!
//! When asterisk/underscore sequences match, and two markers can be “taken”
//! from them, they together relate to the `<strong>` element in HTML.
//! When one marker can be taken, they relate to the `<em>` element.
//! See [*§ 4.5.2 The `em` element*][html-em] and
//! [*§ 4.5.3 The `strong` element*][html-strong] in the HTML spec for more
//! info.
//!
//! When tilde sequences match, they together relate to the `<del>` element in
//! HTML.
//! See [*§ 4.7.2 The `del` element*][html-del] in the HTML spec for more info.
//!
//! ## Recommendation
//!
//! It is recommended to use asterisks for emphasis/strong attention when
//! writing markdown.
//!
//! There are some small differences in whether sequences can open and/or close
//! based on whether they are formed with asterisks or underscores.
//! Because underscores also frequently occur in natural language inside words,
//! while asterisks typically never do, `CommonMark` prohibits underscore
//! sequences from opening or closing when *inside* a word.
//!
//! Because asterisks can be used to form the most markdown constructs, using
//! them has the added benefit of making it easier to gloss over markdown: you
//! can look for asterisks to find syntax while not worrying about other
//! characters.
//!
//! For strikethrough attention, it is recommended to use two markers.
//! While `github.com` allows single tildes too, it technically prohibits it in
//! their spec.
